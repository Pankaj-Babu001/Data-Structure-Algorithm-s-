## 🧩 Problem Description

You are given the root of a binary tree, and your task is to return its top view. The top view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the top.

> **Note:**
> - Return the nodes from the leftmost node to the rightmost node.
> - If multiple nodes overlap at the same horizontal position, only the topmost (closest to the root) node is included in the view.

## 📌 Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 1, 3]
Explanation: The Green colored nodes represents the top view in the below Binary tree.
      1
    /   \
   2     3
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 100]
Output: [40, 20, 10, 30, 100]
Explanation: The Green colored nodes represents the top view in the below Binary tree.
           10
         /    \
       20      30
      /  \    /  \
    40   60  90  100
```

## 📐 Constraints

$$1 \leq \text{number of nodes} \leq 10^5$$

$$1 \leq \text{node}\rightarrow\text{data} \leq 10^5$$
