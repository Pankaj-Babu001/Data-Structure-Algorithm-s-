## Problem Description

Given two binary trees with roots `root1` (for tree T) and `root2` (for tree S), each containing at most N nodes. Determine whether tree S is a subtree of tree T.

Return **true** if S is a subtree of T, otherwise return **false**.

> **Note:** A tree S is considered a subtree of T if there exists a node in T such that the subtree rooted at that node is identical to S. Two trees are identical if they have the same structure and the same node values.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```text
root1 = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4], root2 = [3, 4]
```

**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** In the tree rooted at root1, the subtree starting at node 3 is identical to the tree rooted at root2 (same structure and node values). Hence, root2 is a subtree of root1, so the output is true.

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```text
root1 = [26, 10, N, 20, 30, 40, 60], root2 = [26, 10, N, 20, 30, 40, 60]
```

**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** Both root1 and root2 represent identical trees. So, root2 is a subtree of root1, and the output is true.

## Constraints

- $1 \le n \le 10^3$
- $1 \le \text{value of nodes} \le 10^4$
