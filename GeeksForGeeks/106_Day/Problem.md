## 🧩 Problem Description

Given a directed graph with **V** vertices labeled from `0` to `V-1` and a list of edges `edges[][]`,  
where each edge is represented as `[u, v]` indicating a directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`,  
find a **Mother Vertex** of the graph.

A **Mother Vertex** is a vertex from which **all other vertices can be reached**.

- If **multiple** such vertices exist, return the one with the **smallest value**.
- If **no** such vertex exists, return `-1`.

## 📌 Examples

### Example 1

```
Input:
  V = 5
  edges[][] = [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 4]]

Output: 0

Explanation:
  Vertices 0, 1, and 2 can each reach all other vertices in the graph.
  Among them, 0 is the smallest, so the output is 0.
```

### Example 2

```
Input:
  V = 3
  edges[][] = [[0, 1], [2, 1]]

Output: -1

Explanation:
  No vertex can reach all other vertices in the graph.
  Hence, there is no Mother Vertex, and the output is -1.
```

## 📐 Constraints

$$1 \leq V \leq 10^5$$

$$1 \leq \texttt{edges}[i][0],\ \texttt{edges}[i][1] \leq V - 1$$
