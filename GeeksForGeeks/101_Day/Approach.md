> [!TIP]
> Breadth-First Search (BFS) is inherently suited for finding the "shortest path" or "minimum steps." By exploring strings level by level (where each level represents a number of removals), the first level that contains any valid strings will contain all valid strings with the minimum number of removals.

---

## Technical Breakdown

### 1. Level-by-Level Exploration (BFS)
We use a queue to store strings to be processed.
- **Initial State**: Push the original string `s` into the queue and mark it as visited.
- **Level Processing**: While the queue is not empty, we process all strings at the current level.
- **Minimum Removals**: As soon as we find a valid string at any level, we set a flag `found = true`. We continue processing the remaining strings at the *same* level (to find all possible valid strings with that many removals) but stop generating children for the *next* level.

### 2. State Generation
For each string `curr` pulled from the queue:
1. **Validity Check**: Use `isValid(curr)` to check if parentheses are balanced.
2. **Success**: If valid, add to the results.
3. **Branching**: If no valid string has been found yet at this or any previous level:
   - Iterate through every character in `curr`.
   - If the character is a parenthesis (`(` or `)`), create a new string by removing it.
   - If this new string hasn't been visited, add it to the queue and the visited set.

### 3. Space and Time Trade-offs
Using a `visited` set (typically an `unordered_set`) is crucial to avoid redundant processing of the same string arrived at via different removal paths.

## Visual Representation

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start("[Start]") --> Init["Push Initial String to Queue"]
    Init --> Loop{Queue Empty?}
    Loop -- No --> Dequeue["Pop Current String"]
    Dequeue --> Valid{isValid?}
    Valid -- Yes --> AddResult["Add to Result and set found=True"]
    Valid -- No --> Found{"found == True?"}
    Found -- Yes --> Loop
    Found -- No --> Gen["Generate strings (remove 1 char)"]
    Gen --> Visited{"Already Visited?"}
    Visited -- No --> Push["Push to Queue and Visited Set"]
    Visited -- Yes --> Loop
    Push --> Loop
    Loop -- Yes --> End("[Return Result]")
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $O(N \cdot 2^N)$
  In the worst case, we might explore all possible substrings. Each substring check `isValid` takes $O(N)$.
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(2^N)$
  We store visited strings in a hash set to avoid cycles and redundant work, which can grow exponentially in the worst case.
