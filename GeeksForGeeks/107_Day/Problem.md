## 🧩 Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays `a[]` and `b[]`. Return all the starting indexes of all the occurrences of `b[]` as a subarray in `a[]`.

---

## 📌 Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: 
  a[] = [2, 4, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1]
  b[] = [4, 1]

Output: [1, 4]

Explanation: 
  b[] occurs as a subarray in a[] from index 1 to 2 and from index 4 to 5.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: 
  a[] = [2, 4, 1, 0, 0, 3]
  b[] = [0]

Output: [3, 4]

Explanation: 
  b[] occurs as a subarray in a[] from index 3 to 3 and from index 4 to 4.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: 
  a[] = [1, 3, 5, 3, 0]
  b[] = [1, 3, 0]

Output: []

Explanation: 
  There is no subarray occurs as b[] in a[].
```

---

## 📐 Constraints

$$1 \leq \text{a.size()} \leq 10^6$$

$$1 \leq \text{b.size()} \leq \text{a.size()}$$

$$0 \leq b[i], a[i] \leq 10^4$$
